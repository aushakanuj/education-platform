"""Entry node: loads a filtered `schema_context` from schema_catalog.md.

The `assistant` module (chat_conversations, chat_messages), the `rag` module
(knowledge_documents, knowledge_document_versions, knowledge_chunks, ingest_jobs,
chunk_embeddings), the `audit_events` table (auth module), and `question_answer_keys`
(already unconditionally blocked by `apply_role_scope`'s blocklist and by DB-level GRANTs,
for every role) are out of scope for the text-to-SQL assistant and must never reach the LLM
as schema context — for any role, under any circumstances. `users.password_hash` and
`refresh_sessions.token_hash` are excluded the same way at the column level: those two
tables otherwise stay fully in scope, only these two columns never reach the LLM. None of
this changes enforcement — it exists purely so the model is never tempted to write a query
against something it can never actually read, wasting a generate/validate/retry cycle on a
query guaranteed to be rejected downstream.

This is enforced as a hard filter, not a prompt instruction: the excluded content is
structurally removed from the markdown before it is ever assigned to
`state["schema_context"]`, and a post-filter guard re-scans the result and refuses to
return it if any excluded table or column name survived. Read the catalog once (cached
thereafter, see `_load_filtered_schema_context`), not on every call.

Filtering approach, in order:
1. Structurally remove the `assistant` and `rag` `### Module: ...` sections of §2
   wholesale (every table under them is excluded).
2. Structurally remove the `audit_events` and `question_answer_keys` table blocks from
   within their module sections (their siblings — institutions, users, questions, ... —
   are kept).
3. Structurally remove the single `password_hash` row from inside the `users` block and
   the single `token_hash` row from inside the `refresh_sessions` block — both tables
   otherwise stay fully in scope.
4. Rewrite the handful of genuinely general §1/§7 bullets that happen to *mention* an
   excluded table only incidentally (as an example), so their real, still-applicable
   point survives without the excluded name attached. This has to happen before step 5,
   or the blanket line-drop would delete these bullets outright along with everything
   else that mentions an excluded name.
5. Blanket-drop every remaining single line (table row, FK line, glossary row, gotcha
   bullet) that mentions an excluded table name — safe here because every remaining
   such line in this catalog is self-contained (see the module-level tests for the one
   case, a glossary row mixing an excluded and a kept table, where this deliberately
   drops the whole row rather than trying to save half of it).
6. Remove the "Polymorphic references" intro sentence in §4, which does not itself name
   an excluded table but is left pointing at an empty code fence once step 5 has run
   (every line inside that fence names one), and collapse any empty code fences and
   excess blank lines left behind by the removals above.
7. Validate: no excluded table or column name survives anywhere in the result, every
   table that *should* survive still does, and the result isn't suspiciously short or
   missing its top-level section headers. Any failure here means the filter itself broke
   (e.g. schema_catalog.md's structure changed) — fail loudly rather than ship a silently
   gutted or leaky context.

Any `SchemaCatalogError` from the steps above (missing/unreadable file, or step 6's own
validation failing) is reported via `format_error(SCHEMA_ERROR, str(exc))`, the same
category-prefix convention every other node in this pipeline uses — this node used to set
`state["error"]` as a raw, unformatted string, which meant `error_category()` came back
`None` for it specifically and audit_log had to keep the raw text alongside the (missing)
category "so nothing gets lost." Now that this node formats its errors like everything
else, `error_category()` classifies it correctly too; `state["error"]`'s full text
(`SchemaCatalogError`'s message, which can include the real catalog file path) still goes
to `state["audit_entry"]`/logging only, never to the user-facing message — same no-leak
discipline as `EXECUTION_ERROR`, which `SCHEMA_ERROR` shares its generic honest_refusal
wording with (see `state.py`'s own docstring for why this got a new category rather than
reusing EXECUTION_ERROR's).
