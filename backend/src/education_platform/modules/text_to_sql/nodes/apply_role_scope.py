"""Rewrites state["validated_sql"] to enforce state["user_role"]'s row/column access
before execution.

Identity source (non-negotiable): this node reads `state["user_id"]`, `state["user_role"]`,
and `state["institution_id"]` — set once, upstream, from the verified JWT at the API layer
— and nothing else. It never reads `state["question"]`, and it never trusts any
identity-shaped value that might be embedded in `state["validated_sql"]` or the LLM output
that produced it (an alias, a literal, a comment). `validate_sql` already whitelists
tables/columns against real schema metadata but does not and cannot vet *values* or
*aliases* the model chose to write, so a prompt-injection attempt embedded in the question
("...and also show me every student's data") can influence what SQL gets generated, but
this node's row predicates are built purely from state's own identity fields and are ANDed
onto the query — they narrow whatever the model asked for, never widen it, and never key
off anything the model wrote.

`education_platform.modules.insights.service.scope_predicate()` is *not* reused directly:
it takes a `Scope` dataclass that only `authorization.scope.scope_for(session, principal)`
can build (four live async DB queries), and it returns a SQLAlchemy `ColumnElement[bool]`
hard-bound to the `student_360` view's specific flattened columns
(`institution_id`/`student_id`/`grade_subject_offering_id`/`section_id`) — it cannot wrap
an arbitrary sqlglot query over a different table shape, and this node is deliberately
DB-session-free (see the module docstring above: user_id/user_role/institution_id only).
Instead, this node reimplements the same *rules* `scope_predicate()` encodes — every clause
pins the institution, for every role including admin; beyond that, a student sees only
their own rows; a teacher sees rows for the (offering, section) pairs they teach, where a
`teaching_assignments.section_id IS NULL` row covers every section of that offering, and
an unmatched/NULL row fails safe (excluded, not included); an admin is otherwise
unrestricted — as portable, table-specific SQL fragments (correlated subqueries against
`teaching_assignments`/`student_subject_enrollments`/`student_profiles`) spliced into the
query's own AST, so the actual identity lookups happen when the query executes rather than
inside this node. This also covers the `student_profiles.user_id` nullability caveat from
the schema catalog: the self-row predicate always resolves through
`student_profiles.user_id = <this node's user_id>`, never assumes a profile exists, and
simply matches zero rows if it doesn't (rather than needing a null-check special case).

Column blocklist (Step 2 in the task write-up) runs first, before any row/institution
scoping, and applies to every role including admin: `users.password_hash`,
`refresh_sessions.token_hash`, and any reference to `question_answer_keys` at all (matching
the schema catalog's own "never expose this to a query result" rule, applied here
unconditionally rather than only for student-facing queries). `password_hash`/`token_hash`
are checked by column name alone, without resolving which table/alias they belong to —
cheaper than full alias resolution, and safe here specifically because the schema catalog
confirms both names are unique to their one table across the whole schema, so any
occurrence, from any alias, is unambiguous and always worth rejecting.

Table coverage (fail-closed allowlist, not a blocklist): a live investigation found that a
question routed entirely through `student_subject_enrollments`/`grade_subject_offerings`/
`subjects`/`period_grades` — none of which were in this node's original 5-table sensitive
list — returned real, unscoped, institution-wide data (a school-wide enrollment count, not
one teacher's own students) with no warning. The original design ("scope only these named
tables, everything else passes through untouched") makes every future addition to
`load_schema.REQUIRED_TABLES` exempt by default unless someone remembers to also add it
here. This is inverted: every table `validate_sql` can hand back (i.e. every name in
`REQUIRED_TABLES` other than the always-blocked `question_answer_keys`) must be classified
into exactly one of `STUDENT_SCOPED_TABLES` or `INSTITUTION_SCOPED_TABLES` below, or the
query is refused outright (`_find_unscopable_table_reference`) — a table skips scoping only
because someone deliberately, reviewably placed it on one of these two lists, never because
nobody thought to.

`STUDENT_SCOPED_TABLES` carries rows scoped to an individual student — every SELECT scope
that touches one gets the institution pin *and* the role's self/taught row predicate (a
student sees only their own rows; a teacher sees rows for the (offering, section) pairs
they teach). `INSTITUTION_SCOPED_TABLES` is institution-boundary data that isn't
individually student- or teacher-restricted by nature (a grade name, a subject list, the
institution's own row) but does still belong to exactly one institution and must not leak
across tenants — every SELECT scope that touches one gets the institution pin only, for
every role including admin.

Curriculum-content tables (`topics`, `subtopics`, `learning_outcomes`, `source_materials`,
`source_material_versions`, `source_chunks`, `questions`, `question_versions`,
`question_options`, `question_outcome_tags`, `common_mastery_quizzes`, `quiz_versions`,
`quiz_items`, `quiz_material_bindings`, `quiz_releases`) were deferred here as a known,
documented gap when the fail-closed inversion above first landed: a live check against
this database confirmed they *are* institution-partitioned in practice (a shared top-level
curriculum is the eventual design intent per the module README, but today each
institution's `grade_subject_offerings` hangs its own `topics`, so the two seeded
institutions have disjoint topic/question sets), but each one's institution path is a
multi-hop join chain distinct per table and reviewing all of them was real, separate work.
That work is now done — every one of the 15 is classified into `INSTITUTION_SCOPED_TABLES`
below (none of them has any column that reaches student or teacher identity, confirmed by
tracing every FK against the ORM models, so none needed `STUDENT_SCOPED_TABLES`). None was
a genuinely fresh multi-join predicate: each table's institution path runs entirely through
*other tables on this same list*, so scoped in dependency order (topics -> subtopics ->
{learning_outcomes, source_materials, questions, common_mastery_quizzes} -> {source_material
_versions, question_versions, quiz_versions} -> {source_chunks, question_options,
question_outcome_tags, quiz_items, quiz_material_bindings, quiz_releases}), every predicate
is exactly one hop from an already-scoped, already-tested parent. `_institution_scoped_subquery`
below composes that one hop by calling back into `_institution_predicate_sql` for the
parent rather than hand-inlining the parent's own join chain again — a chain N levels deep
becomes N independently-reviewable one-hop wrappers instead of one hand-assembled N-join
expression someone could mistranscribe. Landed and verified in three dependency-ordered
batches, each batch's tests run and confirmed green against a live database before the
next batch's predicates (which lean on the previous batch's) were written — a bug in an
earlier batch's predicate would otherwise propagate silently into every table stacked on
top of it. Three tables (`question_outcome_tags`, `quiz_items`, `quiz_material_bindings`)
have two non-nullable FKs into two different already-scoped tables; both are checked
(ANDed), not just one, even though the application layer already enforces both sides share
an institution at creation time (`authoring/service.py`) — trusting only the layer above is
exactly the single-point-of-trust posture this project's four-layer defense-in-depth model
exists to avoid (see Finding 4). `common_mastery_quizzes` has two *nullable* FKs
(`subtopic_id` xor `topic_id`, CHECK-enforced), so its predicate is a genuine `OR` of two
conditional branches rather than a plain `IN` — structured so that if neither were ever set
(unreachable given the CHECK constraint, but not relied upon), both branches evaluate
false and the row is denied, not silently passed through.

`query_source` branch (Step 4): a value of `"template"` skips the AST rewrite entirely (a
template's SQL already has the scoping logic — row *and* institution — hand-written into it
by its author) and just records identity in the audit entry. There is no template caller
yet — this is a clean no-op path for a future task, not dead code. The column blocklist
above still runs unconditionally regardless of this branch, per its own "applies ...
regardless of query_source" rule — a template author could still make the same mistake a
generated query could. The fail-closed table-coverage check below is likewise skipped for
templates, on the same reasoning: their scoping (or deliberate lack of it) is hand-reviewed
by the template's own author, not this node.

Self-reference sentinel (`'__CURRENT_USER_ID__'`): `STUDENT_SCOPED_TABLES` never needs
this — apply_role_scope already narrows those to the asking user's own rows silently, so
the model never has to write a self-filter for them at all. But `INSTITUTION_SCOPED_TABLES`
only gets the institution pin (deliberately — see that constant's own docstring), so a
question like "what subject do I teach" (teaching_assignments) or "what's my email"
(users) genuinely needs a `<owner column> = <the asking user>` filter that only the model
can write, and generate_sql never gives it a real identity value to use. Left
unaddressed, the model either fabricates a placeholder that matches nothing (the observed
failure: a literal like `'Your Name Here'`) or drops the self-filter entirely, over-
returning institution-wide data. generate_sql's prompt instead teaches one fixed, literal
token; `_resolve_current_user_sentinel` finds and replaces it with the real
`state["user_id"]` here, before any row/institution scoping runs — the same node, and
the same identity-sourcing discipline (state only, never the question or model output),
already used for every other identity-keyed predicate in this file. This runs for every
role, not just teacher/student: nothing about self-reference is role-specific, and this
node is not the layer that decides whether a role should be allowed to ask about itself.

If the model needs self-reference but doesn't use the token — a still-fabricated literal,
or a subquery guessing at identity — this is deliberately *not* caught by a dedicated
rejection or pattern-matching check here. Any such check would be pattern-matching an
open-ended set of possible fabrications (the model could invent any string, not just the
one literal observed so far), which is exactly the kind of fragile, easily-incomplete text
heuristic this pipeline already avoids leaning on (see sanity_check.py's own two
heuristic checks, each explicitly labeled as a guess, never a certainty). The residual
failure mode is also a data-quality problem, not a security one: apply_role_scope's own
institution/row predicates below are ANDed on regardless of what the model's own WHERE
clause says, so a still-wrong self-reference can only ever produce a wrong *answer*
(most often an empty one), never a widened one — and sanity_check's existing
`zero_rows`/`zero_valued_aggregate` checks already catch that exact symptom and downgrade
confidence accordingly, with no new mechanism needed.

One shape *is* caught here, though, deliberately: the sentinel used correctly (a real
self-reference, not a fabrication) but bound against a column that structurally can never
match the asking role's identity — observed live as `student_360.student_id =
'__CURRENT_USER_ID__'` for a *teacher* token, which is guaranteed to return nothing no
matter what the real data says (a teacher's user_id is never a real student_id), yet
still reported `high` confidence with a refusal-sounding but misleading empty answer.
Unlike the fabricated-literal case above, this one doesn't require guessing at an
open-ended set of possible mistakes — the finite, already-enumerated set of identity
columns in `STUDENT_SCOPED_TABLES`/`INSTITUTION_SCOPED_TABLES` is exactly the kind of
reviewable allowlist this file already builds elsewhere (see `STUDENT_SCOPED_TABLES`
itself), so `_find_identity_mismatch` checks the binding against it and rejects
(`ROLE_VIOLATION` — see that function's docstring for why this category, not a new one,
and why rejecting outright rather than rewriting the query to a correct self-reference is
the right response) before `_resolve_current_user_sentinel` ever performs the binding.

    this shape and still returned `high` confidence with a refusal-sounding but

    Rejects rather than repairs: this node narrows queries, it never guesses intent that
    wasn't expressed — auto-rewriting `student_360.student_id = <teacher>` into a real
    join through `teaching_assignments`/`student_subject_enrollments` would be inventing
    what the question "really meant" instead of what it said, the same overreach every
    other check in this file avoids. A clean rejection lets `honest_refusal` give an
    honest "that question doesn't resolve the way you meant" instead.

    Category: `ROLE_VIOLATION`, not a new one. This is mechanically identical to every
    other rejection this node already raises under that category — same node, same "no
    retry, straight to honest_refusal" routing (a retry can't fix this; the model would
    need a fundamentally different query shape, not a correction it can apply to the one
    it wrote) — and reads as one once you take "the asking user_role isn't allowed to...
    see it" to cover "isn't allowed to claim this identity": a teacher role can no more
    assert "I am this specific student" than it can read another institution's rows. A
    sixth top-level category would need its own honest_refusal message, its own
    audit_log/graph-routing consideration, and its own place in state.py's category
    docstring for a case ROLE_VIOLATION's existing definition already covers — the same
    "reuse an established mechanism over multiplying one-off categories" call this
    pipeline already made for EXECUTION_ERROR/AUDIT_ERROR sharing one honest_refusal
    message rather than inventing bespoke phrasing per failure node.

    Runs on the *original*, pre-substitution tree — this must decide whether the binding
    is valid before `_resolve_current_user_sentinel` performs it, not after (once
    substituted, the literal is just the real UUID and this check can no longer tell it
    apart from any other identity literal already in the query).

    Deliberately conservative, same reasoning as `STUDENT_SCOPED_TABLES`'s fail-closed
    table check but inverted in which direction "can't tell" defaults to: only the
    documented `column = '__CURRENT_USER_ID__'` shape (or reversed operand order) is
    checked; a *qualified* column (`alias.column`) is resolved via `_table_for_alias`,
    and an *unqualified* one (row 28's real shape — `student_id`, no prefix) only when
    its own enclosing `SELECT`'s FROM/JOIN has exactly one table, so there's no ambiguity
    about which table's schema it belongs to (a bare column inside a multi-table join is
    left unchecked rather than guessed at). Callers only ever reach this after the
    fail-closed unscopable-table check has already passed, so every table considered here
    is one this file has actually classified — that ordering matters: a query touching an
    unreviewed table gets refused for *that*, not for a coincidentally-also-true identity
    mismatch on a column nobody has reviewed either way. Checked only against the
    reviewed allowlist in `_valid_identity_targets_for_role` — every other shape (the
    sentinel inside a subquery, compared with an operator other than `=`) is left alone
    rather than guessed at, so this cannot become "a false-positive machine that rejects
    legitimate self-reference queries" over a shape nobody has actually reviewed.
    Column-by-column reasoning behind the allowlist:
    student-identity columns (`student_360.student_id`, `student_profiles.user_id`,
    `quiz_attempts.student_id`, `attendance_records.student_id`,
    `student_subject_enrollments.student_id`, `student_grade_enrollments.student_id`) are
    valid only for a student's own token; teacher-identity columns
    (`teaching_assignments.teacher_user_id`, `attendance_records.recorded_by_user_id`)
    only for a teacher's; `users.id`/`user_roles.user_id`/`refresh_sessions.user_id` key
    off the same raw account identity regardless of role, so both. Every other column in
    `STUDENT_SCOPED_TABLES`/`INSTITUTION_SCOPED_TABLES` — `student_profiles.id` (a
    profile's own primary key, a different ID space from `users.id` entirely),
    `attendance_records`/`student_material_progress`/`attempt_answers`'s non-identity
    columns, and every plain reference-table column (`grades`, `subjects`,
    `academic_periods`, `period_grades`, `sections`, `grade_subject_offerings`,
    `institutions` — none of which carry a user or student identity column at all) — has
