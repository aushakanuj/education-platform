"""Writes one complete audit record for every run of this graph — success or refusal —
via the existing `audit_events` table / `audit.service.record_event()`, the same
generic append-only log every other governed read in this codebase already writes to.

**Reusing `audit_events` rather than a dedicated table** (see Task 10's own write-up for
the full investigation): `AuditEvent`'s shape — typed `institution_id`/`actor_user_id`/
`event_type`/`entity_type`/`entity_id` columns plus a free-form JSON `payload` — already
exists specifically to carry event-specific richness (`record_scoped_read()` already
stores several structured fields in `payload`), and `AuditAction.ASK_DATA` ("data.ask") is
an unused enum member clearly reserved for this exact feature — "ask-the-data" is this
pipeline's own product name elsewhere in the codebase (see e.g.
`frontend/src/pages/teacher/AssistantStubPage.tsx`). A second table would only fragment
the audit trail across two places an administrator has to check, for no capability this
pipeline actually needs (no relational queries over audit data are required — a JSON
payload search/display is enough). Task 3's exclusion of `audit_events` from the LLM's
`schema_context`, and Task 7's exclusion of it from the restricted `text_to_sql_reader`
role's grants, are both about the *text-to-SQL query path itself* (what the model may
reference, what that read-only role may touch) — neither applies here: this node writes
via the normal `education` app role (`db.session.get_session_factory()`, not
`get_text_to_sql_session_factory()`), the same session/role every other audit write in
this codebase already uses, since persisting an audit row requires INSERT, which the
restricted reader role deliberately does not have.

**What's recorded, every time:** `question`/`user_role` (no dedicated columns for these,
so they go in `payload`); `user_id`/`institution_id` go in `AuditEvent`'s own typed
`actor_user_id`/`institution_id` columns, not duplicated into `payload`; `generated_sql`
and `validated_sql` in full — this is the one place in the whole pipeline raw SQL is
allowed to be persisted (it must never reach `compose_answer`'s output or any user-facing
field, but an auditor needs the real query); the full `schema_linking_tables_selected`
list link_schema chose for this question (or `null` if it fell back to the full,
unnarrowed catalog — either because no table matched lexically, or because this node ran
before link_schema existed on a given code path) — retrieval-trace logging, the same
practice a RAG pipeline's context-selection step would get, since it's the direct answer
to "why did/didn't the model know about table X for this question" that neither
`generated_sql` nor `validated_sql` alone can show; `result_row_count`, `confidence`, the
full `sanity_check_triggers` list, `retry_count`, and `outcome` ("answered"/"refused") plus, if
refused, both the formatted error *category* (`error_category(error)`) and the raw error
text (`error_detail`) — every node in this pipeline now formats `state["error"]` via
`format_error()` (load_schema's SCHEMA_ERROR closed the last gap, where its own
unformatted string used to make `error_category()` come back `None` for it specifically),
but `error_detail` is kept regardless, for every category, not as a fallback for an
unparseable one: `SchemaCatalogError`'s message can carry the real catalog file path,
`SQLAlchemyError`'s can carry schema/constraint fragments — detail an auditor
investigating a real failure needs and the category alone doesn't carry, the same reason
`execute_sql` separately records `execution_error_type`/`execution_error_detail` rather
than trusting `EXECUTION_ERROR` alone to be enough. `created_at` is `AuditEvent`'s own
server-defaulted timestamp column — nothing extra needed for that.

**Not recorded: `query_result`'s actual row contents, only `result_row_count`.** Copying
result rows into `payload` would create a second, JSON-typed, harder-to-govern copy of
exactly the sensitive data `apply_role_scope` exists to restrict — no field-level
redaction, no schema, unbounded growth as more queries run, sitting in a table with its
own access surface (`/admin/audit-events`) separate from the governed read paths the rest
of this codebase uses. `validated_sql` (already logged in full) plus `result_row_count` is
enough to reconstruct or re-run the query for debugging or a compliance investigation; a
genuine need to freeze the *exact historical* result (distinct from "what does re-running
this query show now") would be a deliberate, separately access-controlled archival
decision, not something to fold into a general-purpose audit payload by default.

**Fail-closed on the audit write itself failing.** This project's charter treats
role-based access and the audit trail as equally committed guarantees (see `AUDIT_ERROR`
in `state.py`), not one a fallback for the other — the same reasoning that makes
`apply_role_scope` refuse rather than serve a policy-violating answer applies here: an
answer that exists with no corresponding audit record is a charter violation, not a minor
bookkeeping gap. Concretely, `audit_log` is the terminal node (no routing edge exists to
send it back through honest_refusal), so "fail-closed" means overwriting
`state["natural_answer"]` with an honest refusal and setting `state["error"]` to
`AUDIT_ERROR` before returning — the caller never receives the already-composed answer
without a matching audit record existing.

The content that would have been the audit row — question, both SQL strings, confidence,
retry count, everything `_build_payload` assembled — is logged in full alongside the
exception when the write fails, not just a fixed message. Fail-closed only protects
against an *unaudited answer reaching the user*; it does nothing for the record itself if
the only trace of it disappears too. The application logger (not the database) is the
fallback durable store for that content in this failure path — recoverable from logs even
though it never made it into `audit_events`, which is a materially better outcome than
losing the content outright.

**No retry on the audit write itself — a deliberate choice, not an oversight.** A
transient connection blip could in principle be absorbed by retrying before treating the
write as failed. This pipeline already has a precedent for exactly this class of decision:
`execute_sql` (Task 7) does not retry a DB-level failure either — a timeout or connection
error there routes straight to `honest_refusal`, no retry loop. The *only* retry loop in
this whole graph (`generate_sql` re-prompting the model, gated by `MAX_RETRIES`) exists
because that failure is model-correctable; a DB connection hiccup is not the kind of thing
another attempt at composing SQL fixes, and retrying here would be the only place in the
pipeline treating an infrastructure failure as retryable, inconsistent with how
`execute_sql` already handles the identical failure class one node earlier. Given
`audit_log`'s write goes through the same Postgres instance the rest of the request path
already depended on to get this far, a failure here is at least as likely to be a real,
non-transient problem (a constraint violation, a schema mismatch) as a one-off blip a
retry would actually help with. Accepted as a real availability cost for this POC, not
resolved — a production version of this feature would more likely decouple the write
entirely (e.g. an outbox/queue with its own retry policy) rather than retry synchronously
inline here.
