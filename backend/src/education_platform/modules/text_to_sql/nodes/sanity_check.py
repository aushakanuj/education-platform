"""Inspects state["query_result"]/state["result_row_count"] — already executed by Task 7
— and sets state["confidence"]. Observes and annotates only: never modifies the query,
never re-runs anything, never touches `query_result` itself.

Eight independent checks, each capable of downgrading confidence off a `"high"` start.
More than one can fire on the same result; the recorded reasons list every trigger that
fired, and the final confidence is the **worst** (lowest) of their individual severities
— a "low"-severity trigger anywhere wins over any number of "medium" ones, never averaged
or overridden by a later check. Each trigger's own severity is fixed in `_TRIGGER_SEVERITY`
below, reviewable in one place:

* **Zero rows** (`zero_rows`, medium) — always recorded when it happens, so compose_answer
  can phrase "no matching records" honestly rather than as if a number/list were found, but
  deliberately *not* treated as "no downgrade at all". A genuinely correct query can return
  nothing (the task's own example: "how many students failed" when none did), so this never
  drops to "low" on its own. But this node has no reliable, non-fragile way to tell "this
  empty result is the expected answer" apart from "role-scoping or a WHERE clause silently
  excluded everything" — re-parsing the question to guess intent is exactly the kind of
  fragile heuristic the other checks below are already leaning on as little as possible.
  A flat, unconditional "medium" is the simple, predictable, safe-direction default: it
  never overclaims confidence in an empty result that might be a bug, and it's exactly
  the same "fail toward caution, not toward false confidence" choice this codebase already
  makes elsewhere (e.g. `authorization.predicate._taught_predicate`'s NULL-section handling).
* **Zero-valued aggregate** (`zero_valued_aggregate`, medium) — `SELECT COUNT(*) ...`
  always returns exactly one row, even when the count is 0 (unlike a list-shaped query,
  which returns zero rows for the same real-world fact) — so `zero_rows` above, which keys
  off `result_row_count == 0`, can never catch this shape at all, and a genuinely-zero
  count previously read as fully "high" confidence purely because of *how* the question
  was phrased, not because the underlying result was any more trustworthy. Fires on the
  same single-row/single-column shape `compose_answer._compose_core_answer` already uses
  to detect "this is a scalar answer" (deliberately reusing that same simple, existing
  result-shape check rather than adding fragile SQL-text/AST "is this an aggregate query"
  detection that nothing else in this pipeline needs), when that one value is a numeric
  zero — not `NULL`, which is Task 9's separate, correctly-handled
  "no data available" case (`compose_answer._single_scalar_answer`'s `value is None`
  branch) and must keep going through that path untouched, never this one. Same "medium"
  severity as `zero_rows`, for the identical reason: a genuine zero and a role-scoping
  failure that silently returned nothing are indistinguishable from the result alone,
  regardless of whether the query happened to be phrased as a count or a list.
* **Row-cap truncation** (`row_cap_truncated`, low) — reads
  `state["audit_entry"]["row_cap_truncated"]`, the flag `execute_sql` (Task 7) sets when it
  had to truncate. Lower severity than the heuristic checks below: this isn't a guess, it's
  a known fact that the result is incomplete by construction, not merely uncertain.
* **Aggregate sanity bounds** (`aggregate_out_of_bounds`, low) — any row's value for a
  known 0-100 percentage-shaped column (`PERCENTAGE_COLUMNS`, matched against the actual
  column names schema_catalog.md documents as `Numeric` 0-100 percentages, not guessed)
  outside `[0, 100]`. This is structurally impossible from correct SQL against these
  columns, so if it happens something upstream is wrong — "low", the strongest downgrade.
* **Single-row result for a list-shaped question** (`single_row_for_list_question`,
  medium) — a heuristic on `state["question"]`, deliberately conservative: only fires when
  the question matches a roster/list phrase (`_LIST_SIGNAL_PHRASES`) *and* doesn't also
  match an aggregate phrase (`_AGGREGATE_SIGNAL_PHRASES`) — "what's the school's overall
  attendance rate" matches neither pattern's intent to override the other incorrectly
  ("overall"/"rate" suppress the list read), so it stays at "high" as it should. A guess,
  not a hard rule, hence "medium" rather than "low".
* **Suspiciously large result for a bounded-scope question**
  (`large_result_near_cap`, medium) — a question implying a personally-scoped, bounded
  roster (`_BOUNDED_SCOPE_PHRASES`, e.g. "my students") returning close to `execute_sql`'s
  own row cap is a useful cross-check against Task 6, not just a data-quality signal: it
  can mean apply_role_scope's rewrite didn't actually narrow anything. Still a heuristic on
  free text, so "medium" like the check above, not "low" — but worth investigating
  regardless of the label if it ever fires. A question that returns a genuinely large,
  correctly-scoped result without any bounded-scope phrasing (e.g. "how many students are
  in the whole school") never matches `_BOUNDED_SCOPE_PHRASES` and so never fires this at
  all — see the false-positive test in test_text_to_sql_sanity_check.py.

* **Duplicate entity in a roster result** (`duplicate_entity_in_roster`, medium) — the
  same `full_name` value appears in more than one row of a multi-row result. Added after
  a live, confirmed production case: a question asking for students' names alongside their
  marks joined `quiz_attempts` directly and returned the same student once per qualifying
  attempt (see `generate_sql.py`'s own docstring for the full incident) — a syntactically
  valid query, correctly authorized, that still returned a materially wrong answer no
  earlier check here could catch (it isn't zero rows, isn't an out-of-bounds percentage,
  and a duplicated name doesn't shrink `result_row_count` the way `row_cap_truncated`
  would). This check does not — and structurally cannot — determine *why* two rows share a
  name: it could be exactly that duplicate-row bug, or it could be two different real
  students who happen to share a name (confirmed to actually happen in this platform's own
  seed data — multiple distinct students named e.g. "Sami Yusuf" exist). Both readings are
  worth surfacing rather than silently trusting a duplicate-looking roster, so this fires
  either way at "medium," the same severity as the other two heuristic checks below, never
  "low" — a repeated name is a real, visible fact about the result, but which explanation
  applies isn't something this node can resolve from the rows alone. Fires against the raw
  `query_result`, independent of which shape `compose_answer` ends up rendering it in (its
  own deterministic roster-with-attribute path renders duplicates as-is rather than hiding
  them, by the same reasoning — this check is what actually flags that they're there worth
  a second look, not just that they're rendered honestly).

* **Borderline template-match confidence** (`borderline_template_confidence`, medium) —
  `state["query_source"] == "template"` and `state["intent_confidence"]` cleared
  `intent_router`'s routing floor (`template_route_min_confidence()`, imported from that
  module rather than a second copy of the 0.90 default so the two can't drift) by less
  than `_BORDERLINE_CONFIDENCE_MARGIN`. Added because `intent_confidence` was previously a
  fully dead signal — computed by `intent_router`, never read by any downstream node or
  persisted — so a template match that barely cleared the bar (0.90) looked, everywhere
  including the audit trail, identical to one the classifier was highly sure of (0.99).
  This is the same kind of routing-uncertainty signal `single_row_for_list_question`/
  `large_result_near_cap` already surface for the free-form path; a template match is the
  one shape those two structurally cannot cover (they reason about the *result*, and a
  template's result can look perfectly ordinary even when the *routing decision* that
  picked it was shaky). Only fires on the template path — a `None` `intent_confidence`
  (free-form, or `intent_router` itself failed and fell back) never triggers this, since
  there is no routing floor to have barely cleared.

All four of the last checks are guesses, not certainties — their recorded reason strings
say so explicitly (a `"heuristic (...): ..."` prefix), so the audit trail itself never
reads as a confirmed finding for these four, unlike the row-cap/aggregate-bounds checks
above, which are facts.

Routing (graph.py): `state["confidence"]` is the authoritative signal — it is fully
decided here, not by which graph edge fires afterward. graph.py's conditional edge after
this node stays the binary `"suspicious"`/`"normal"` split that already existed as
scaffolding: `"medium"` routes the same way `"low"` does, both via `"suspicious"`, because
nothing downstream currently behaves differently between the two — compose_answer reads
`state["confidence"]` directly for its own phrasing, not the edge that was taken to reach
it. Collapsing "medium" and "low" into one edge loses no information for exactly that
reason. See graph.py's `_route_after_sanity_check` for where this is decided.
