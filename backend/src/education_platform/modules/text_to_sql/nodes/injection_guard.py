"""Entry node: refuses a question that looks like a prompt-injection/jailbreak attempt
before any SQL is even attempted — the first node in the graph, before `load_schema`.

**This is a cost/UX layer, not the security boundary.** Nothing about the safety of this
pipeline depends on this node catching anything. `apply_role_scope`'s row predicates are
built purely from `state["user_id"]`/`state["user_role"]`/`state["institution_id"]` and
never key off the question or the LLM's output — a successfully-generated adversarial
query is already neutralized downstream regardless of whether this node ever fires (see
that node's own docstring, and golden-eval rows 35-38, which cover exactly this scenario
and pass today with no guard in front of them at all). What this node buys is real but
narrower: skip the OpenRouter round-trip entirely for the subset of questions that are
*unambiguously* adversarial by surface phrasing, and give the audit trail a distinct,
honest signal ("this looked like an attack attempt") instead of lumping it in with an
ordinary answered-or-refused query. A false negative here (a phrasing this doesn't
recognize) costs one wasted generation call, never a data exposure; a false positive
costs one legitimate question an unnecessary refusal, never a silent wrong answer (see
`_MESSAGES` in honest_refusal.py — the refusal text is honest about being a refusal, not
disguised as a real "no data" answer).

**Borrowed from `assistant.graph`'s own `injection_guard`, not reinvented.** That pipeline
(a document-retrieval/summarization graph, structurally unrelated to this one) already has
a working two-stage version of exactly this idea: `assistant.graph._heuristic_injection`'s
regex list for the cases that are essentially always attacks with almost no legitimate
phrasing collision, falling through to an LLM classifier for anything the regex doesn't
recognize. This is a fresh implementation with its own state shape and its own classifier
prompt (this pipeline's actual stakes — bypassing role-based *data access* — are
different from that one's "stay on policy topic" framing, and `TextToSQLState` carries no
multi-turn `history` the way `AssistantGraphState` does, so there's no prior-turn context
to feed the classifier here), but the regex list itself is reused verbatim: these
behavioral tells ("ignore previous instructions", "developer mode", "jailbreak") aren't
specific to what the LLM is being asked to do, only to how someone is trying to talk to
it. `chat_completion_json`/`OpenRouterError` are imported directly from
`assistant.openrouter` rather than duplicated — `generate_sql.py` already does the same
for its own, unrelated OpenRouter call (`chat_completion`), confirming this is a genuinely
shared, module-agnostic utility, not something specific to the assistant pipeline it
happens to live in.

**Fail-open when unconfigured, fail-closed when erroring — same asymmetry as the
original, kept deliberately rather than "simplified" away.** If `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
isn't set at all, this is a known, permanent deployment state, not a live problem — the
heuristic regex still ran, and refusing every question outright because the *second*
stage can't run would make this cost/UX layer into an availability outage, for a check
that was never the security boundary to begin with. If OpenRouter *is* configured but the
call itself fails (network, rate limit, malformed response), that's a live, transient
signal worth being cautious about — refusing this one question and asking the user to
retry costs far less than silently skipping a check that was specifically requested to
run. Both branches still leave `apply_role_scope` as the only thing anyone should trust
for actual safety, regardless of which way this asymmetry resolves for a given call.

**Off-topic detection (`OFF_TOPIC_REJECTED`) was briefly combined into this same
classifier call, then measured and reverted — see `question_validator.py`, the node that
now owns it.** The combined design traded a small amount of one-node-one-category purity
for not doubling this pipeline's per-question LLM cost, on the explicit condition that
combined-call accuracy had to match a separate-call baseline before it could be trusted.
That comparison hadn't actually been run before it shipped; running it after the fact
found a real, 100%-reproducible (8/8 repeated trials) false positive on an ordinary,
common self-reference question — "What subject do I teach?" — under the combined prompt,
while the equivalent separate, off-topic-only classifier call got the same question right
every time, and the rest of the same question shape (rows 16-18: "what sections am I
assigned to", "what is my own attendance rate", "am I currently teaching Grade 7") stayed
clean under both, so this wasn't a systematic weak spot for self-reference questions in
general — just a real, decisive miss on this one, common phrasing, caused by the combined
call's own framing. A common question failing 100% of the time in production is a real
cost, not the marginal one the combined design was supposed to be trading for; see
`question_validator.py`'s own docstring for the full numbers and the current design.
