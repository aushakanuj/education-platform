"""HTTP endpoint for the text-to-SQL ("ask-the-data") pipeline.

**Teacher-only, deliberately.** `require_role("teacher")` (the same reusable role-gate
dependency every other role-restricted endpoint in this codebase already uses — see
`api.deps.require_role`, used exactly this way by e.g. `insights.router`) rejects with 403
before the route handler body runs at all, so a non-teacher request never reaches
`_GRAPH.ainvoke(...)` — not a silent no-op, and not something routed into the graph to be
refused there. Student, administrator, and parent access are each a **separate, not-yet-made
design decision**, not an oversight: a student's own-data scope, an admin's institution-wide
scope, and a parent's scope in particular (which has no existing design or test coverage
anywhere in this codebase — `authorization.scope.Scope` has no parent concept at all) would
each need their own review before this endpoint should serve them. Widening the allow-list
here is a deliberate future change, not a bug to fix.

**Identity**: `question` is the *only* field this endpoint reads from the request body.
`user_id`/`user_role`/`institution_id` come only from `principal` (`api.deps.Principal`,
resolved from the verified JWT by `require_role`/`get_current_user`) — the same identity
rule Tasks 6-10 enforce inside the pipeline, applied one layer further out. `user_role` is
hardcoded to `"teacher"` here rather than read off `principal.roles`: this endpoint is the
teacher capability specifically, so the pipeline should apply teacher scoping even for a
principal who happens to also hold another role, not whichever role happened to be "first."

**The compiled graph is built once, at import time** (`_GRAPH`), not per request.
`build_text_to_sql_graph()` takes no per-request arguments — every node reads identity from
`state`, not from a closure (contrast `assistant.graph.build_assistant_graph(*, principal,
...)`, which must rebuild per request because its `retrieve_node` closes over `principal`
directly). A compiled `StateGraph` is just wiring — a fixed set of node functions and edges
— with no per-invocation mutable state of its own (no checkpointer is configured here), so
it's safe to share across concurrent requests, and re-registering every node/edge on every
single call would be pure overhead for no benefit.

**Response shape is exactly three fields**: `natural_answer`, `confidence`, `provenance`.
`generated_sql`, `validated_sql`, `query_result`, and `audit_entry` are never included —
enforced structurally, not just by omission: the handler builds an `AskOut` instance
field-by-field rather than ever doing `AskOut(**result)` or returning the raw graph state,
so there is no code path that could accidentally widen the response to include an internal
field later.

**Outermost timeout/failure net.** Task 11 documents `honest_refusal` as provably
exception-free, and every failure category upstream of it is designed to route there rather
than raise — but this is the outermost layer of the whole system, the one place with no
further catch above it, so it does not trust either guarantee blindly. `asyncio.wait_for`
bounds the whole graph run; both a timeout and any exception that still escapes (a bug, not
an expected path) are caught here and turned into a generic, no-internal-detail HTTP error —
the same "real detail to logs, generic detail to the response" split `execute_sql` (Task 7)
and `audit_log` (Task 10) already established, applied one layer further out.
