"""Postgres-backed tests for the text-to-SQL compose_answer node.

One thing here needs a live database and can't be proven by a pure unit test: the
row-cap-truncation disclosure sentence chained from a *real* execute_sql (Task 7)
truncation through sanity_check (Task 8) into compose_answer — not a hand-set
audit_entry flag, which test_text_to_sql_compose_answer.py already covers as a pure unit
test in isolation. Same rigor as Task 8's equivalent chained test.

Also includes one full-compiled-graph smoke test, now that compose_answer is no longer a
pass-through placeholder — confirming a real natural_answer/provenance actually comes out
the other end of the whole pipeline, not just confidence (which Task 8's own integration
tests already covered).
