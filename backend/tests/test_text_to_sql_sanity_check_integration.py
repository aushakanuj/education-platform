"""Postgres-backed tests for the text-to-SQL sanity_check node.

Two things that need a live database and can't be proven by a pure unit test:

1. state["confidence"] surviving unchanged from sanity_check, through routing, through
   the still-placeholder compose_answer, all the way out of the compiled graph.
2. The row-cap-truncation check actually chained from a real execute_sql (Task 7)
   truncation — not a hand-set audit_entry flag, which test_text_to_sql_sanity_check.py
   already covers as a pure unit test on the flag in isolation.
