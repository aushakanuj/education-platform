    institution-pin-only with no self-restriction) that nobody was mechanically
    checking for. This test introspects the *real* ORM column names (not a hand-typed
    guess) for every table currently in INSTITUTION_SCOPED_TABLES, flags any
    `*_user_id`/`user_id`/`owner_id`-shaped column, and requires it to appear in

    immediately instead of silently repeating the exact gap that caused the live leak
    — forcing the same kind of deliberate, one-entry-at-a-time review this file
    already uses everywhere else (STUDENT_SCOPED_TABLES/INSTITUTION_SCOPED_TABLES
    themselves, deferred_curriculum_tables above, _TEACHER_IDENTITY_TARGETS/
    _STUDENT_IDENTITY_TARGETS), not a guess at what "probably" needs it.
