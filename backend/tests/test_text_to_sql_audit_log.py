"""Postgres-backed tests for the text-to-SQL audit_log node.

Every test here needs a live database — there is no meaningful DB-free unit test for a
node whose entire job is "persist a row to audit_events" — same rationale as
test_text_to_sql_execute_sql.py and test_authorization_scope.py, which use the same
`clean_db` fixtures.
