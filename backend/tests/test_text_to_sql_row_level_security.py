"""Tests for the 5th defense-in-depth layer: Postgres Row-Level Security (migration
`e1f2a3b4c5d6`), enforced inside the database itself rather than in this pipeline's
Python.

This file's central technique, used for most tests here: run the *same* base query two
ways for the *same* identity, and confirm they agree.

1. Through `apply_role_scope` (`_run_scoped`, imported from
   test_text_to_sql_apply_role_scope_integration.py) — the existing, already-reviewed
   app-layer rewrite, executed as the full-privilege `education` role (RLS has no effect
   on it; `education` has BYPASSRLS -- see the migration's own docstring).
2. Raw, unmodified, as `text_to_sql_reader` with the session identity variables set
   (`_raw_rls_query` below) — no AST rewrite at all. Only RLS can restrict this.

Agreement between the two, table by table, role by role, reusing the exact two-
institution/two-teacher/all-sections fixture already built for Finding 4 and Finding 5
(`seeded`/`_Fixture`, imported rather than re-seeded), is the actual proof this task asks
for: RLS is an independent mirror of the same rule, not a coincidentally-similar one.
