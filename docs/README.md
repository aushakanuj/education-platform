# Education Platform Documentation

**Agentic Platform for Automated Education Management and Analytics** — a multi-role system where
administrators publish shared source curriculum, enrolled students study through a private learning
directory (reference-not-copy), and teachers consume class evidence. The POC proves a focused loop:
publish → study → common subtopic quiz → four-pillar evaluation → teacher evidence.

Two complementary directories anchor the product model:

- **SourceCurriculum** — administrator-owned AcademicPeriod → Grade → Subject → Topic → Subtopic
  tree with published source materials and one common mastery quiz per subtopic.
- **StudentLearningDirectory** — private per-student view that references published sources and
  stores progress, attempts, and evaluation snapshots.

See [abstract system view](./design/00-abstract-system-view.md) for the full component model.

## Implementation status

Status legend: **Built** | **Partial** | **Mock** | **Deferred**

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JWT auth (student + admin) | **Built** | Demo accounts seeded in development |
| Roles in schema/API | **Built** | `administrator`, `teacher`, `student` |
| Grade + Grade–Subject enrollment gate | **Built** | Students require active enrollments |
| `GET /me/learning-directory` | **Built** | Primary catalog API; admin bypasses enrollment |
| Curriculum seed from markdown | **Built** | [`docs/curriculum/`](./curriculum/) → Postgres |
| Student study + quiz + scoring | **Built** | No answer keys on student APIs |
| Legacy `GET /materials` | **Built** | Flat list; prefer learning-directory |
| Admin materials browser (`/admin/materials`) | **Built** | Read-only; live API |
| Admin policy assistant | **Partial** | Live multi-chat + LangGraph (injection → validate → retrieve → summarize) via OpenRouter; needs `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for LLM stages |
| Teacher workspace (`/teacher/*`) | **Mock** | Frontend fixtures; no teacher backend APIs |
| Material upload / publish UI | **Deferred** | Design in [04](./design/04-material-lifecycle-and-ai-artifacts.md); admin UI stubs disabled |
| Four-pillar evaluation snapshots | **Deferred** | Designed in [06](./design/06-analytics-and-comparison-insights.md); not in backend/frontend yet |
| Ingestion + vector indexing | **Partial** | Ingest/index only (admin PDF upload → Postgres queue → chunks + pgvector); grounded assistant still Deferred |
| Grounded AI assistant | **Deferred** | Bounded component; POC foundation only |
| Postgres / pgvector | **Built** | Compose `pgvector/pgvector:pg16`; embeddings in `chunk_embeddings` |
| Postgres ingest workers | **Built** | `ingest_jobs` + `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`; local `UPLOAD_DIR` blobs (MinIO still Deferred) |
| MinIO object storage | **Deferred** | Local uploads for POC |
| React Native client | **Deferred** | Target in [architecture diagrams](./architecture/diagrams.md) |
